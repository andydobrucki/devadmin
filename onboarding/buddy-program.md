## Who delegates a buddy?

A buddy gets assigned by Team Lead when a new hire arrives in their new team. Buddy can also volunteer by asking their Team Lead to help a new hire.

## How do I start ?

1. Schedule a video call with the new hire and: 
   * Introduce the new hire into the working culture of the company / team 
   * Set up weekly 30m calendar meeting with the new hire for an agreed period. 
   * Explain that outside of regular 30m meeting, you’re going to be available for questions, generic problems, anxieties for the agreed time over Slack and that you will provide immediate feedback 
   * if you see improvement points . 
2. Meet the buddy even if there are no obvious discussion points. In this case treat the meeting as a water-cooler chat and an opportunity to get to know and understand the new hire.
